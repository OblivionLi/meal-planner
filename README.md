# meal-planner

#### The meal planner app allows users to effortlessly add meals and their corresponding ingredients, which are then stored in a database and presented in an aesthetically pleasing format. Furthermore, the app offers the convenient feature of categorizing meals by type for each day of the week, displaying the entire plan afterwards. Additionally, it provides the ability to export a shopping list, containing all the necessary ingredients for the planned meals, into a text file.
